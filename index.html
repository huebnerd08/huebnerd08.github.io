        Our mission

    <p>
        Our mission at City Snooze is to provide a safe, comfortable, peaceful oasis for you to rest your body.

    <h2>
        About us
    </h2>
    <p>
        The City Snooze Story began with our fearless leader and founder Kerry P. Berton. Kerry is a lifelong narcoleptic, who over a lifelong career of run-ins with police, made it her mission to challenge societal constructs on what is and isnt a proper sleeping space. Kerry, and all of us at City Snooze, know that sleep is the most important third of your day, and in our fast past world more than 37% of Americans aren't getting their doctor recommended sleep. Through the advent of Snooze Cubes in major cities, we are making an impact by providing a safe, affordable place for Americans of all kinds to catch some Z's.

     "When I travel to Seattle for work, I need a private, isolated space to rest my head. No shower, no toilet. Just a pillow and my favorite stuffed animal. City Snooze helps me look upon the world with fresh eyes."
     - <strong>Jasper</strong>

     "I'm honestly surprised City Snooze hasn't turned me away, yet. I frequent their Bad Part of Town location, and have disgraced my sleeping cube in my drunken stupor. I've returned and used the same cube the next day for my post work cry, and it's like last night had never happened." - <strong>P.D. Shameful</strong>

    "After a busy day downtown I needed a power nap before my long bike ride home to the Eastside. City Snooze provided me a comfortable space to refuel and relax so that I could continue my trip safely feeling refreshed. One of the best naps I've ever taken!" - <strong> Amy</strong>
